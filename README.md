# POC Digital Communications

## Introduction

This repo investigates the potential aspects of the project so we can gain an understanding of the potential issues and solutions.

## TODO
Below is a list of the things that need to be investigated to understand what solutions are available.
1. Investigate the use of an open source HTML editor such as CKEditor or TinyMCE. Can it easily be integrated into a website that would allow us to generate templates with tags, for each of the individual channels of communication.
2. What is the ability of the CKEditor or other to work in a predefined page with static boxes laid out for envelope etc configuration. Use the @page html attributes to define the boxes and the use inline HTML editor to specify the layout within each box.
